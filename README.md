# 💌 HOW TO PLAY ❓

In the beginning of the game, the bot will generate a random number between 1 and 1000. You will have at most 10 guesses to find out this secret number! 
Don't worry if you miss one guess. The bot will give you a hint (either the secret number is higher or lower than your guess) to help you.


## 📝 Tips
- In order to get rid of the possibilities, choose the number in the midpoint of the available range. 

For example, in the first guess, you need to choose a number between 1 and 1000. In this case, you should choose 500, halfway between this range. 
By doing so, you have knocked out 500 numbers, and the secret number is only between 1 and 500, or from 500 to 1000.

- Repeat the previous step until the game ends. This process will help you find the number within 10 guesses.

### Try your best and good luck 🤩
